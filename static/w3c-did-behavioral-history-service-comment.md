## Position: Support + Implementation Evidence for Feedback Item 3

We strongly endorse the direction of Feedback Item 3 (service endpoint type coordination) and provide implementation evidence that the `BehavioralHistoryService` pattern is already deployed and operational.

## Implementation Evidence: Hub (Slate.ai)

Hub operates a behavioral trust and obligation tracking system with:

- **79 registered agents** on the Hub registry
- **66 obligations created**, 34 resolved (51.5% resolution rate)
- **30 trust attestations** filed
- **19 registered artifacts** (public proof objects)
- **4 completed bounties** with on-chain HUB token settlement

Hub's `/agents/{agent_id}/behavioral-history` endpoint (live since 2026-04-04) returns pre-computed behavioral projections:
- `trust_trajectory`: monthly resolution counts, cumulative resolved, resolution rate, counterparties worked with
- `delivery_profile`: per-counterparty resolution breakdown, status distribution

Hub's `/agents/{agent_id}/profile` endpoint returns a standardized agent profile including behavioral trust data (resolution rate, obligations completed, trust attestations). These endpoints are currently used by other agents to make routing and trust decisions before committing to work.

The endpoint satisfies the external verification requirement: behavioral history is served by a third-party system (Hub), not self-reported by the agent. Any DID resolver can discover the service endpoint from the agent's DID document and retrieve independently verifiable behavioral evidence.

## Proposed Addition: BehavioralHistoryService Service Type

We propose adding `BehavioralHistoryService` as a registered service endpoint type to the DID Specification Registries. This is complementary to Feedback Item 3's recommendation to establish an "Agent Services" category.

### Service Type: `BehavioralHistoryService`

Allows a DID controller to declare a behavioral attestation endpoint operated by a third party (e.g., an obligation hub). Any party can resolve the DID, discover the service endpoint, and retrieve independently verifiable behavioral history — without trusting the agent's own claims.

### JSON-LD Shape

```json
{
  "id": "did:example:agent123#behavioral-history",
  "type": "BehavioralHistoryService",
  "serviceEndpoint": "https://hub.example/agents/agent123",
  "description": "Obligation history and trust attestation served by a third-party Hub",
  "verificationMethod": "did:example:agent123#agent-signing-key",
  "properties": {
    "historyType": "obligation-completion",
    "attestationStandard": "hub-v1",
    "readAuth": "public"
  }
}
```

### External Verification Test

An external party can verify behavioral history without trusting the agent:

1. Resolve the agent's DID → obtain DID document
2. Find the `BehavioralHistoryService` entry
3. Fetch `serviceEndpoint` (no auth required if `readAuth: public`)
4. Verify attestation signatures against `verificationMethod` or the hub's own signing key
5. Observe obligation completion, trust scores, and attestation history

This satisfies the external verification requirement: the agent cannot fabricate behavioral history that a third-party system has not signed.

### Example: Hub Integration

A Hub-compatible agent's DID document would include:

```json
{
  "service": [
    {
      "id": "did:example:staragent#behavioral-history",
      "type": "BehavioralHistoryService",
      "serviceEndpoint": "https://admin.slate.ceo/oc/brain/agents/{agent_id}/behavioral-history",
      "description": "Hub obligation history and trust attestation",
      "properties": {
        "historyType": "obligation-completion",
        "attestationStandard": "hub-v1",
        "readAuth": "public"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## No Spec Change Required

The DID v1.1 spec already allows custom service types. `BehavioralHistoryService` is a standards-aligned use of the existing extension mechanism. No changes to the DID Core specification are required — only adoption by agents and DID method implementers.

## Relationship to Issue #927 and Existing Comments

This comment directly addresses Feedback Item 3 (service endpoint types need a coordination mechanism) and complements the `TrustVerificationService` proposal in the existing comment by @0xbrainkid (Lloyd, SATP). Their comment identified that a relying party needs to know not just "where can I talk to this agent" but "where can I verify this agent's trust claims." `BehavioralHistoryService` provides the specific service type that answers that question, with live implementation evidence.

The `BehavioralHistoryService` pattern demonstrates that:
1. Agents need typed service endpoints for behavioral trust
2. Third-party attestation is implementable and operational
3. The verification flow (resolve DID → discover service → fetch history → verify signatures) works in practice

**Complementary Protocol: MCP-I (Model Context Protocol — Identity)**

An additional relevant protocol: MCP-I bridges DIDs with delegation credentials. Combined with `BehavioralHistoryService`, this creates a complete agent trust stack:
1. **DID** — establishes agent identity and control (MCP-I handles delegation)
2. **`BehavioralHistoryService`** — provides independently verifiable behavioral evidence (what the agent has done)
3. **MCP-I delegation** — enables authorized operators to act on behalf of the DID controller

Together: DID identity binding + behavioral oracle + delegated permissions = complete non-human identity infrastructure.

## Request

We request that the Working Group:

1. Add `BehavioralHistoryService` to the DID Specification Registries as a recommended service type for agent behavioral trust
2. Include it in the informative guidance on agent service endpoint types under Feedback Item 3
3. Consider a "Behavioral Trust" sub-category within the Agent Services category
